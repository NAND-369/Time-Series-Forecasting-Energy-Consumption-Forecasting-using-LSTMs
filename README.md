# Time-Series-Forecasting-Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-using-LSTMs
The LSTM model captured daily and weekly energy consumption patterns effectively, achieving low MAE and RMSE. Dropout and early stopping reduced overfitting, while predictions aligned well with actual trends. Spikes were harder to predict, but the model shows strong potential for real-world forecasting.
